This is a showcase of how CADET Process and its filter model extension can be used to model interconnected unit operations in batch mode.

To set up, create a Conda environment from the provided .yaml file.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate cadpythonsim
```

The example simulation can be found in 'main.py'. Change the current directory to the code path and run main.py. Process parameters may be changed in the file.
